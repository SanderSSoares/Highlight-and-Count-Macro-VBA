# Highlight-and-Count-Macro-VBA
Highlight &amp; count rows that match a name/department/etc., and place the count in the first empty column to the right of your data.  Summarize counts by group (e.g., how many rows per Department) and output a tidy frequency table in that same “next empty column” area.
